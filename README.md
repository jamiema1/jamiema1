### Hobbies

## 🧗 Bouldering

Last summer I went bouldering for my birthday with a few friends and was instantly hooked. Ever since, I have been going consistently around 2-3 times a week, mainly to the various Hive Climbing locations around Vancouver. Currently, I can consistently climb 3 Hexes (V2-4) and a few 4 Hexes (V4-6) here and there. My current goal in bouldering is to be able to climb most 4 Hexes and maybe sprinkle in a few 5 Hexes. In addition to bouldering, I have recently been going top roping to broaden my skillset by strengthening my endurance while climbing. In this discipline, the hardest I have climbed is a 5.11-, but I am hoping that by going more often I will see some progress.

## 🎻 Violin

I have been playing the violin now for around 2/3rds of my life. It has been a staple hobby for me that has stuck since the very beginning. Although finding time to play it has been hard recently due to school and other time constraints, I always know that I can rely on it to help me destress and allow me to express my emotions freely. While I am a classical trained musician, I also enjoy playing music from other genres such as animes and pop.
