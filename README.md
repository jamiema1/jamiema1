### Hobbies

#### 🧗 Bouldering

Last summer, I went bouldering for my birthday with a few friends and was instantly hooked. Ever since, I have been going consistently around 2 times a week. I primarily indoor boulder at the various Hive Climbing locations around the lower mainland, with my favourites being the Surrey and Poco locations. Currently, I can usually flash most 3 Hexes (V2-4) and try to project a few 4 Hexes (V4-6) every session. My current goal in bouldering is to be able to consistently climb most 4 Hexes, as well as to be able to do few a 5 Hexes if they suit my style. In addition to bouldering, I have recently been going top roping to broaden my skillset by strengthening my endurance while climbing. In this discipline, the hardest I have climbed is a 5.11-. With summer fast approaching, I am hoping to go outdoors and see how my skills transreal rock.

#### 🎻 Violin

I have been playing the violin now for about as long as I can remember. It has been a staple hobby for me that has stuck with me since the very beginning. Although finding time to play it has been hard recently due to school and other time commitments, I always know that I can rely on it to help me de-stress and allow me to express my emotions freely. While I am a classically trained musician, I also enjoy playing music from other genres such as animes and pop.

#### ⛷️ Skiing




#### ⚾ Baseball

Growing up, baseball was one of the team sports that I enjoyed playing every spring/summer.
